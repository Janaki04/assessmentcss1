        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="line"> CSS is not neccesary</span><span class="color"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can control the layout of multiples web pages all at once</li>
        <br>
        <li class="style">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="heading2">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul type="disc" class="lists2">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML element.</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS,is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="color">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it is used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p class="para">In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p class="para">There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a styles should be applied</p>
